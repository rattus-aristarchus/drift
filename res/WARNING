NAMES INSIDE EACH FIRST-LEVEL FOLDER OF NAMESPACES SHOULD BE UNIQUE

e.g.:
namespaces/first_namespace/entities.yaml "some_entity"
namespaces/second_namespace/entities.yaml "some_entity"
-
is okay; however:

namespaces/first_namespace/sub_folder/entities.yaml "some_entity"
namespaces/first_namespace/another_sub_folder/entities.yaml "some_entity"
-
IS NOT OKAY, they won't be recognized as separate entities by the system
